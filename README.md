# Operating System
This repo contains my notes, exercie solutions as well as lab solutions for the Operating System Engineering
Course. In this file, I will record my progress and the notes for the course and
solutions.

## xv6

```
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6) by MIT.
xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern x86-based
multiprocessor using ANSI C.
